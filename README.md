# HandWritten-digit-and-character-recognisation
Hello guys ,
    This project is based on CNN (convolutional neural network) which is made by me by using some inbuilt libraries of python which are associated by python.
    I prefer VS code and Jupyter Notebook both for this project.
    This project has two parts:-
        1)- Handwriting digit recognition--> used mnist dataSet
        2)- Handwriting character recognition--> In this project I use dataSet from kaggle.com and having sizeof more                 than 600 mb due to which I was unable to uploaad on github for that I am posting the link of DataSet in                   character library.
I perform both digit and character on seperate files on vs code and jupyter Notebook.
At the END, I found files are running successfully and output are accurate.
